o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Data structures and algorithms are crucial for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, especially when dealing with large datasets. 

o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

ArrayList: Good for ordered collections where elements can be accessed quickly using an index. However, operations like insertions and deletions can be slow if they involve shifting elements.

HashMap: Provides fast access, insertion, and deletion based on keys (e.g., productId). Itâ€™s efficient for looking up items and managing products with unique identifiers.

TreeMap: A sorted map implementation that keeps the keys in natural order. It provides log(n) time complexity for basic operations.

o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.

As I am using a HashMap for this problem average time complexity for insertion, updation and deletion is O(1) i.e, constant time.
